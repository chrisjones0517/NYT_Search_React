### Description
This is a MERN full-stack application that searches the New York Times article search API, and allows users to save articles for future reference. Users can enter search terms, with search dates going back to the beginning of the NYT in late 1851. If no results are returned, a message is displayed to inform the user of the status of the current search. Search results are returned with headlines, dates, a summary, and links to the original NYT articles.  Results are returned in groups of 10. If a user would like to see more, clicking the 'get more results' button will populate the page with 10 more results (or the remaining available articles). Users can save articles for later by clicking the 'save' button. By clicking the 'Saved Articles' link in the navigation bar at the top of the page, users can access the saved articles of all previously saved articles by all previous users. From this page, users can read or delete articles by clicking the respective buttons in the populated containers. A persistent session could be a future feature addition that would allow 'Saved Articles' to be specific to the current user.
